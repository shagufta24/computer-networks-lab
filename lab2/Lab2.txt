Lab Task 2: Error detection and recovery

This lab focuses on detection of bit errors and recovering from such errors.

Task: Generate a NxN matrix of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s only,  at the client. The client transmits this matrix to the server.
Before transmission, the client may induce a 1-bit error in the data at random.  A 1-bit error means 1 is changed to 0 or 0 is changed to 1.

Programming Tasks
1. Design and execute a program to detect all such 1-bit errors
2. Design an error correcting code so that the server can correct the 1 bit error.
3.  use the sample client and server files shared with earlier as base.(Protocol is of your choice ie TCP or UDP)
