Lab Task 3: Error detection and recovery

Specification 1: Recover from the error.

Problem input: Assume that you have a set of strings where the maximum length of any string is 10 characters. You can transmit a limited number of strings per transmission. There is likely to be 1-bit (one bit) error in each such transmission.  Design and implement a scheme to recover the damaged string in each transmission. The existing code of Lab 3 must be reused for this lab to get full credit.
